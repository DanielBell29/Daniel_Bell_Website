            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">AV Engineering Portal</h2>
                <p>Two years ago, while working for an AV company, I became increasingly frustrated with the outdated process of writing up job surveys. The process involved filling out a form created in a program similar to Microsoft Word. It was cumbersome, frequently crashed, and took an excessive amount of time to complete. More importantly, the form had only one photo upload field and had to be emailed, which often resulted in it getting lost in translation.</p> 
            
                <p>With my background in Web Development, I was dismayed by the lack of a reliable and efficient method for writing up our job surveys.</p> 
            
                <p>To address this issue, I started brainstorming and eventually mocked up a very crude <a href="https://job-survey-form-v1.netlify.app/">version</a> of the portal you see today. I decided to use Flask for the backend, connecting it to a PostgreSQL database to securely manage all customer information.</p> 
            
                <p>Initially, my goal for the portal was simply to create a survey form for the engineers. However, it has since evolved into a much larger application, now supporting the business support team, warehouse operations, and the engineering coordinator. I continue to improve the portal, regularly adding new features based on requests from the team.</p> 
            
                <p>Due to security and privacy concerns, I am unable to provide login access to the portal. However, I have included screen captures of each section of the site for your reference. Please note that the company logo has been removed from these images to maintain confidentiality.</p>

This functionality has proven highly popular among engineers, as it enables them to easily review any job created, allowing them to identify potential issues before they arise. The benefit of centralizing all this information is significant for the company, as it ensures that no critical data is overlooked.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">A recent addition to the portal has streamlined the user experience by reducing clutter on this page, introducing a dropdown menu for each job.</p> 
                            
                            <p>Each job card is automatically generated upon submission of the Job Form, and a corresponding Completion Certificate is also automatically created.</p> 
                            
                            <p>With the automatic generation of each job, users are presented with several options within the job card itself:</p> 
                            
                            <p><strong>Open Job - </strong>This option allows the user to open and edit the job form, which is useful if additional information is required or if any details were inadvertently omitted.</p> 
                            
                            <p><strong>Add Engineer - </strong>Available to managers, this feature enables an engineering coordinator to assign an external subcontractor to upcoming jobs. The subcontractor will have access to the job details without the ability to view or modify any other information within the portal.</p> 
                            
                            <p><strong>Completion Certificate - </strong>This feature automatically generates a Completion Certificate based on the data entered during the creation of the Job Form. This automation significantly improves the efficiency of managing Completion Certificates, eliminating manual processes.</p> 
                            
                            <p><strong>Send Completion Certificate - </strong>A common challenge faced by engineers is the unavailability of customers to sign the Completion Certificate at the end of a job. To address this, the engineering coordinator can simply click this link to send a tokenized version of the Completion Certificate directly to the customer’s email. The customer can access and sign the certificate without needing to log in to the portal.</p>

                            <p>The indicator light is initially set to red by default, signifying that the Completion Certificate has not yet been reviewed or signed by either the engineer or the customer.</p> 
                            
                            <p>Once the engineer completes their section of the Completion Certificate (awaiting customer signature), the indicator changes to amber, signaling that the job is in progress and awaiting final approval.</p> 
                            
                            <p>Upon the customer signing the Completion Certificate, the indicator turns green. This change provides the engineering coordinator with a clear and immediate visual cue that the job is complete and ready for invoicing.</p>
